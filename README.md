  Assignment 8
====================


__This is the Repository created by Zhenyi Huang.__

This assignment has adapted an abridged version of the [stat545.com shiny tutorial](http://stat545.com/shiny01_activity.html) written by Dean Attali, 
In this assignment, I have added various features shown as follow: 

## Features

* Add an option to sort the results table by price.
* Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI.
* Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an interactive table.
* Add parameters to the plot.
* Place the plot and the table in separate tabs.
* When the user wants to see only wines, show a new input that allows the user to filter by sweetness level. Only show this input if wines are selected.

## Shiny Apps
