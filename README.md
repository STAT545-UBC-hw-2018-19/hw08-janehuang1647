  Assignment 8
====================


This is the Repository created by Zhenyi Huang.
In this assignment, I have attempted the Task 1 and Task 2. For better access to the assignment, I will suggest you to [__download__](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw06-janehuang1647/blob/master/assignment_6.html) the html file below 馃憞, since the github can not render the html file properly.

### Goal of the assignment
* __Character data__ Read and work the exercises in the Strings chapter or R for Data Science.
* __Writing functions__ Write one (or more) functions that do something useful to pieces of the Gapminder or Singer data. It is logical to think about computing on the mini-data frames corresponding to the data for each specific country, location, year, band, album, 鈥? This would pair well with the prompt below about working with a nested data frame, as you could apply your function there.
